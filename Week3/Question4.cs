// Question #4:
// Develop a C# app that will determine the gross pay for each of three employees. The company pays
// straight time for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and 1.5 times for all hours worked in
// excess of 40 hours. Youâ€™re given a list of the three employees of the company, the number of hours
// each employee worked last week and the hourly rate of each employee. Your app should input this
// information for each employee, then should determine and display the employeeâ€™s gross pay.
